## Slide 2: C++ Rule of Three

**Slide Text Summary:**

C++ Rule of Three
C++ Rule of Three
Recall RAII
constructor is solely responsible for new
destructor is solely responsible for delete
Rule of Three: if a class defines any of these, it must define all three:
Destructor
Copy constructor
Copy assignment operator

## Slide 3: Why?

**Slide Text Summary:**

Why?
Why?
These are the member functions that initialize an object
Obligated to handle new/delete
Recall
Destructor: called to destroy an object ~ needs to delete owned data members
Copy constructor: called to copy an object ~ needs to make a new copy
Copy assignment operator: called to assign = an object ~ needs to make a new copy

## Slide 4: Example: MaybeInt

**Slide Text Summary:**

Example: MaybeInt
Example: MaybeInt
class MaybeInt: either owns
One integer in dynamic memory; or
Nothing
Example to illustrate Rule of Three
Single responsibility principle: better to use std::optional instead
